 FIRST_NAME:0 "The Turning Point of the Century"
 FIRST_DESC:0 "1860 dawns with rising tensions worldwide. Conflicts arise within the new German Confederation, Italy cries for unity, and the United States appears to be on the verge of all out civil war. From this point on, the world is changed. A new era of wars is upon us."
 ENG_FIRST_DESC:0 "With the crowning of Queen Victoria in 1837, a new era started in Europe. England sat at her place on the top of the world, nearly unrivaled in naval strength, with the crown jewel of India subdued. England now looks South, to Africa, the new global frontier."
 FRA_FIRST_DESC:0 "Napoleon III chose to rise to power and follow in the footsteps of the great Emperor Napoleon and lead the French Empire to greatness. France now looks towards her foreign colonies in Africa and Oceania, and to her east. The Prussians are a threat to France, and they will not easily be put down."
 PRS_FIRST_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Prussia stands at the top of the German Confederation. As the true leaders of the German people, unity is necesarry. Under the rule of Otto von Bismarck, the German people must be led together!"
 AUS_FIRST_DESC:0 "The Habsburgs have ruled Europe for centuries. At the head of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria was the prime power in Europe. Now, with their empire declining, and a new power on the rise, Austria must fight to claim their rightful place once again."
 TUR_FIRST_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire holds the reigns on the Mediterranean Sea. The entire land trade from Asia is theirs. They are in a position of power, with land stretching from Tunisia to Java and the future looks bright for the Empire."
 SOV_FIRST_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire stands strong against threats in the east and west. Border conflicts with both Prussia, Austria, and Japan, have shown that conflict is not new to the Empire. A war is enevitable, but its target still unclear."
 USA_FIRST_DESC:0 "Tensions are at their highest as some states in the US look to secession. A civil war is enevitable, and the result will be earth-shattering. Will the Western Hemisphere's strongest country stay unified, or fall together?"
 OTHER_FIRST_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 RAJ_FIRST_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
